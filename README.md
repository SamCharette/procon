# ProCon
A simple pros and cons list, that will have the following planned features
----

* Simple entering and editing items on each side
* PWA, so it will be able to be hosted on github, and can be used like an app
* Clear visuals on which "side" is winning
* Ability to determine a range that is considered "too close to call"
* Weight per item (how important it is)
* Probability per item (how likely it is to occur, given best guess from user)
* Decision tree based on probabilities
* Export to file (to save for later)
* Import from file
* User data & configuration propagated between uses without saving (so if you come back after closing the browser, it will be where you left it)
* Some sort of report if using probability and decision trees?
